We need to add code to cache the files locally.
    - We can modify the b_hitquery_1_svc() routine to also pull the file into a
      local cache and add it to the list.

      Approaches for local cache :
        - We could keep the cached files in a separate directory.
        - The index file could be the same as before.
We can have a 

- Today for each file we maintain only the host names which are serving it.
  In addition to this we need to keep :
    - version number of the file.

- A command to update the version of the file. Or a command line option to
  obtain_client would do.
    - The obtain-server will update the revision of the file and send a
      broadcase message to all the neighbors.
        - Message contains the following info :
            - FIlename
            - version number.

        - Each neighbour which sees this message will check its local cache and
          if outdated deletes the cache file.
                - For this to work the peer server will maintain the cache files
                  in a separate dir.
                - In the index dir we maintain the following info :
                       cached-version=<version-no>
                       <origin-server-name> 
                       <origin-server-name> 
                       <origin-server-name> 
                - So, when an invalidate message is received we do the following :
                    - modify the file in indexdir to make the <version-no> to -1
                      to indicate that we no longer have a cached entry
                    - delete the cached file.
                    - fetch a new file.
                    - modify the <version-no> with the current version.
