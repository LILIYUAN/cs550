* We assume that the data servers are all empty in the begining
* All the entries / data is created only by a valid pnfs client that we have written
* Even though we can have data in data sevrers and the corresponding meta data for them can be
  created while the data servers registers - this is not taken care of [ out of scope ]
* When the meta data server is started, a list of ds servers is given to it. This list cannot be 
  altered later. This functionality is out of scope for us. This can be acheived however it is 
  out of scope of the proposal.
