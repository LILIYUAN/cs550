This file explains the steps involved in compiling the code. And also the steps
to start the servers and the client application.

Steps to compile the code :
---------------------------
- Executable name : obtain_client obtain_server 
- We have a Makefile script "Makefile.obtain". This script invokes the make for both 
  obtain server and obtain client
    - obtain_server : The peer server which should started by each peer to share
      the files from a directory
    - obtain_client : The peer client which the user should use to fetch the
      files.

Steps to start the peer server :
--------------------------------
- Executable name : ./obtain_server
- Put all the files that the peer server wants to share in a directory.
  For example we have share1 directory which has the following files.
    -- snip --
    $ ls -l share1
    total 640
    -rw-r--r-- 1 sbagewad stud  31679 2011-02-27 16:46 file1
    -rw-r--r-- 1 sbagewad stud  10530 2011-02-27 17:22 file-10k
    -rw-r--r-- 1 sbagewad stud   1053 2011-02-27 17:17 file-1k
    -rw-r--r-- 1 sbagewad stud  15879 2011-02-27 18:33 file2

    -rw-r--r-- 1 sbagewad stud   3159 2011-02-27 17:18 file-3k
    -rw-r--r-- 1 sbagewad stud   4212 2011-02-27 17:18 file-4k

- The peer sever takes the following arguments :
    -- snip --
    $ ./obtain_server
     Usage : ./obtain_server <hostname> <index-server-name> <share-dir>

     hostname : Local hostname of the machine
     peer-list-file : file containing the Hostnames of the peers
     share-dir : Directory that you would like to share
    -- snip --

  Here is an example of starting the peer server on compute-0-0.cs.iit.edu with
  index server running on "csrocks" :

    -- snip --
    $ ./obtain_server compute-0-0 relay-test/compute-0-0.peers data/share0
    Registering file : file-2k to the index-server : csrocks
    Registering file : file-10k to the index-server : csrocks
    Registering file : file-1k to the index-server : csrocks
    Registering file : file1 to the index-server : csrocks
    Registering file : .svn to the index-server : csrocks
    Registering file : file-7k to the index-server : csrocks
    Registering file : file-6k to the index-server : csrocks
    Registering file : file2 to the index-server : csrocks
    Registering file : file-5k to the index-server : csrocks
    Registering file : file-8k to the index-server : csrocks
    Registering file : file-3k to the index-server : csrocks
    Registering file : file-9k to the index-server : csrocks
    Registering file : file-4k to the index-server : csrocks
    Registering file : pa1.pdf to the index-server : csrocks
    Now ready to serve them
    -- snip --

    NOTE :  1> The peer servers can be started on multiple servers.
                For example we tried starting the peer servers on :
                    - compute-0-0 relay-test/compute-0-0.peers "./share1"
                    - compute-0-1 relay-test/compute-0-3.peers "./share3"
                    
            2> We cannot start multiple peer servers on the same node as they all
            use the same RPC program number and hence would overwrite the
            registration with rpcbind (ie. rpc port mapper).



Steps to use the peer client :
------------------------------
- Executable name : ./obtain_client
- The peer client (obtain_client) takes the following arguments :
    -- snip --
    $ ./obtain_client
     Usage : ./obtain_client [-f] <file-name> <localhost-name> <dest-dir>

     -f : With this option it fetches the file from the first available peer
     file-name : name of the file that you are searching 
     localhost-name : Hostname of the local machine from where the search will start
     dest-dir : Destination directory where you want to copy the fetched file
    -- snip --

- Example of fetching a file with interactive option :
  Assuming :
    - we are looking for the file "file-1k". 
    - the local host name is "csrocks"
    - we want to save the fetched file in "/tmp"
    Here is how the client is executed :

    -- snip --
    $ ./obtain_client file-1k csrocks /tmp
    Created the client
    searching(file-1k) 
    Time taken by index server = 0 secs
    Total number of peers serving file-1k = 2
    Peers service  192.168.0.102 are :
        0 : compute-0-0 
        1 : compute-0-1
    Pick the peer from which you want to fetch from : 1
    obtain_1_svc() : Served 1053 bytes from ./share1/file-1k at offset : 0
    Time taken to fetch the file = 0 secs

    sbagewad@csrocks:~/trunk/pa1/p-to-p$ head /tmp/file-1k
    aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa
    aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa
    aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa
    aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa
    aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa
    aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa
    aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa
    aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa
    aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa
    aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa
    -- snip --

- We have "-f" for the non-interactive way of petching the file. Here the app will
  pick the first listed peer and then fetches it from that peer.

    -- snip --
    $ ./obtain_client -f file-1k csrocks /tmp
    Created the client
    searching(file-1k) 
    Time taken by index server = 0 secs
    Total number of peers serving file-1k = 2
    Peers service  192.168.0.102 are :
        0 : compute-0-0
        1 : compute-0-1
    Time taken to fetch the file = 0 secs
    -- snip --

- The client is also smart to try other listed server (if it fails to fetch from the choosen one).
  Assuming we killed the obtain server on compute-0-0. It would try to fetch it from the next
  server which is serving it

    -- snip --
    $ ./obtain_client -f file-1k csrocks /tmp
    Created the client
    searching(file-1k) 
    Time taken by index server = 0 secs
    Total number of peers serving file-1k = 2
    Peers service  192.168.0.128 are :
        0 : compute-0-0
        1 : compute-0-1 
    compute-0-0 :  RPC: Remote system error - Connection refused
    Failed to fetch the file from host:compute-0-0                  <-------******* Retry in action
    Trying next server                                              <-------*******
    Time taken to fetch the file = 0 secs
    -- snip --
