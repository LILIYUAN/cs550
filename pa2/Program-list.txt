Obtain Server files (aka. Peer server):
---------------------------------------
obtain.x        : The RPC definition of the obtain server. 
obtain.h        : The header file generated by rpcgen
obtain_xdr.c    : The XDR routines for marshalling generated by rpcgen .
obtain_server.c : The CRUX of the peer server. This file has to code to relay / propogate
		  the search to all its peers. This is file has the code to
                  serve chunks (4Kbytes) of the file requested.
obtain_svc.c    : The server side skeleton generated by rpcgen. This was used as
                  the baseline for implementing the multithreaded skeleton
                  (obtain_svc_mt.c).
obtain_svc_mt.c : The multithreaded server skeleton which has the code to
                  register the files being served. And then serving the requests
                  for chunks of files.
obtain_clnt.c   : The client stub generated by rpcgen.
obtain_client.c : The client app that the users will use to fetch the files.
Makefile.obtain : The makefile generated by rpcgen and later modified to add the 
                  multithreaded (obtain_svc_mt.c) instead of standard (obtain_svc.c).


Accompanying scripts and docs :
-------------------------------
test.sh         : The script which was used to call the obtain_client in a loop
                  for 200 times to stress test.
Manual.txt      : The Manual which explains the usage of each component
Peer-list-files : The configuration files used to start the server and register 
                  its  peers are placed in the respective configuration directory
clear_all.sh    : clear_all.sh goes and kills the instance of the obtain server
                  if running on all the nodes. It even clears the config information
                  stored in /tmp/indsvr directory.
other scripts   : There are other scripts like star-4node.sh, mesh-12n0de.sh et all
                  which are used to start the obtain server on multiple nodes with
                  their corresponding config files and shared data.

Test files :
------------
The following directoties contains test files ranging from 1Kbytes to 11Kbytes
and a large PDF file (pa1.pdf) of size 512kbytes :
    - data/share1
    - data/share2
    - data/share3
    .

    .
    - data/share14
