Problem Statement :
    - The scalibility of a network filesystems is limited if we have single
      server.
    - One of the solutions is to increase the bandwidth by spreading the load
      across multiple servers.
    - And along with the above solution we should still have unified namespace.
    - The idea is to implement a pNFS like filesystem and achieve data striping.

Basic Design :
    Add the diagram

    Main components :
        - FUSE client on the client machine
        - Metadata Server
        - DataServer

How is metadata of the files maintained ? File Layouts
    
    - The metadata server maintains the segment details as file layouts

        <size>
        <extent-record>
        <extent-record>
        <extent-record>
    - Each extent record is as below :
        <offset> <length> <data-server-name> <extent-name>

Read/Write Operations :
    - Steps taken during a read/write.

Command line interface :

    - How to start the metadata server ?
        $ ./mds_server -d <share-dir> -f <dslist>

    - How to start dataservers ?
        $ ./ds_server -S <mds-server-name> -d <share-dir> -s <mds-server> -i fsid

        NOTE : Today we ignore the fsid. But, can be later used to identify the
        exact filesystem when multiple filesystems are shared.

    - How to mount on the client ?
        $ ./pnfs_client -S <mds-server-name>
                        -f <fs-name-shared-by-mds-server>
                        <local-mnt-point>
Results :
    - The following operations were tested :
        - create files and write data to them.
        - verify their contents by reading
        - write large files and verify striping

Future work :
    - Implement sharing of multiple filesystems
    - Dynamic addtion of data servers.
    - Page caching for better response times
    - Implementation of the missing filesystem operations

Conclusion :
    - This is a basic pNFS like filesystem which does the striping effectively
    - Not all filesystem operations work. But framework is available to
      extend/implement them.
