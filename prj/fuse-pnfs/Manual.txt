This file explains the steps involved in compiling the code. And also the steps
to start the servers and the client application.

Steps to compile the code :
---------------------------
- Executable name : mds_server ds_server pnfs_client 
- We have a Makefile script "Makefile.mds_ds". This script invokes the make for both 
  mds_server and ds_server and even the pnfs_client

    - mds_server : The server which maintains all the meta data for all the data
      residing on all the data servers. This should be started first. The pnfs client
      interacts with this server first to perform any operation. Most of the operations
      are served from this server except few like read / write. 

    - ds_server : The server which hosts all the data in the system. Usually multiple 
      instances of the data server exists in the system. All the read and write operations
      are served from these servers.

    - pnfs_client : This is the client used to interact with the pNFS system. This client can 
      interact with the mds_server to perform the operations. For read and write operations
      it gets the location of the data from mds_server and then makes calls to ds_server to 
      perform actual read and write.

Steps to start the mds_server :
--------------------------------
- Executable name : ./mds_server
  Usage: ./mds_server -d <share-dir> -f <ds-servers-file>
   <share-dir>         : The directory that is being shared
   <ds_servers-file>   : The file containing the list of ds-servers for this FS

  mds_server : share-dir mds_share : is not an absolute path !
  mds_server : Please provide an absolute path for <share-dir>

  - share-dir : should be empty while starting the server. This is the placefolder for meta-data
  - ds_servers-file : This is a file on the local file system having entries for each
    data server in the system. One entry is made for each ds server. 
    
    Sample ds_servers-file 
   -- snip --
    compute-0-0.local
    compute-0-1.local
    -- snip --

Steps to start the ds_server :
-------------------------------
- Executable name : ./ds_server
  Usage: ./ds_server -d <share-dir> -s <mds-server> -i fsid
   <share-dir>    : The directory that is being shared
   <mds-server>   : The name of the mds-server for this filesystem
   <fsid>         : The fsid of the filesystem being served (provided by mds-server for this filesystem 

  ds_server : share-dir ds1 : is not an absolute path !
  ds_server : Please provide an absolute path for <share-dir>


  - share-dir : This dir should be empty while starting and is the place holder for actual data.
  - mds-server : IP / DNS of the machine where the metadata server mds_server is running
  - fsid : Give any non zero number, say 0 or 1


Steps to start the pnfs_client :
--------------------------------
- Executable name : ./pnfs_client
  Usage : ./pnfs_client -S <server_name> -f <filesystem> <local_mountpoint>
   <server_name> : The name of the metadata server

  - server_name : The name of the mds_server from where we mount the nfs volume
  - local_mountpoint : the local drectory from where the nfs file system is mounted.

Steps to use the pnfs client :
------------------------------
Once the volume is mounted we can cd to the directory where it is mounted 
and perform any operations like normal.
